    "](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.35.7423). This is mainly to be able to perform the computations without high-performance computers and still have somewhat reasonable results for simple solids such as Al.  The method is based on an ansatz that assumes that the total electron density can be expressed as a sum of the electron densities of individual atoms. The electron densities of the individual atoms are calculated separately assuming that each atom is embedded in a homogeneous electron gas. It's not necessary to understand this approximation in detail to perform the exercises. We really just need a simple calculator to get energies and forces... Our typical workflows use DFT.\n"
