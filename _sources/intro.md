# Introduction

This tutorial is aimed at developers who would like to develop workflows with Jobflow. This could include contributions to [atomate2](https://github.com/materialsproject/atomate2) and [quacc](https://github.com/Quantum-Accelerators/quacc). Jobflow workflows can also be executed with [Fireworks](https://github.com/materialsproject/fireworks) on Supercomputers.

This tutorial includes information on how to write a job for jobflows, how to connect jobs to a workflow including dynamic features and how to store job results in databases. The structure of the workflow is inspired by workflows that have been developed for [atomate2](https://github.com/materialsproject/atomate2) and [quacc](https://github.com/Quantum-Accelerators/quacc).

This tutorial is also connected to binder and google collab so that you can execute the code via their services.

## Contributions
